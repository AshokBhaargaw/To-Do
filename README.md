A simple Kanban-style To-Do application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This app allows users to create, edit, delete, and drag & drop tasks between To-Do, Working, and Done columns. All tasks are saved in LocalStorage so they persist after refreshing the page.

📝 Edit tasks in real-time
🗑️ Delete tasks with a trash button
🎯 Drag & Drop tasks between columns (To-Do → Working → Done)
💾 LocalStorage support (your tasks stay after refresh)
🎨 Responsive design for desktop and mobile
